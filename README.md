# Battleship_game
My first game on Python(2.7).
This is a my version of "sea battle" game. I made it only to get practise in programming on python, and it was fun.
- In this game you can choose the size of the field (4x4, 6x6 or 10x10).
- You can choose the number of tries that you will need to destroy all the ships.
- In each game all the ships are generated randomly.
- In the end of the game you will see your statistics and can start to play again.
